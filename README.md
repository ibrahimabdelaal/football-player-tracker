 ## Football Player Tracking using ByteTrack \
**Dual Tracking** \
* ByteTrack: \
Responsible for tracking individual soccer players. \
Offers a balance between accuracy and speed. \
* ByteTrack_Reid:
Specifically designed for ball tracking, enhancing capabilities to follow the ball effectively.
Leveraging Strengths
ByteTrack provides efficient player tracking while maintaining accuracy.
ByteTrack_Reid improves ball tracking precision through feature extraction using res_net.
Enhanced Performance
By integrating both trackers, we aim to achieve comprehensive and accurate tracking of players and the ball throughout the match.

* Fine-Tuning Process\
Matching Threshold: Optimized to identify the best threshold for accurately matching detections across frames.\
Confidence Threshold: Adjusted to ensure confidence in the tracking results, minimizing false positives.\
Kalman Filter: Fine-tuned to predict player and ball movements, improving tracking accuracy.\
Feature Extractor\
ByteTrack_Reid: Employs ResNet as the feature extractor, although it hasn't been fine-tuned specifically for this task.\
For improved performance, consider fine-tuning ResNet on a dataset dedicated to soccer player and ball tracking.\
## Bird's Eye View
We provide a bird's eye view of the field, visually displaying player and ball movements for better understanding of the game dynamics.
Result Visualization
Refer to the provided video for a visual demonstration of the tracking results in action.
Usage
Install required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the main script with the following command:
Bash
python main.py --input_video path_to_video
Use code with caution. Learn more
Replace path_to_video with the actual path to your video file.

Additional Notes
This readme provides a high-level overview of the project. For detailed implementation details, please refer to the project code itself.
Feel free to modify and customize the pipeline based on your specific needs and available resources.
Formatting:

I've added headings with appropriate levels (###, ####) for better readability.
I've used bullet points for lists to improve scannability.
I've added short descriptions for technical terms like "Kalman Filter" and "ResNet" to make the readme more accessible to a wider audience.
