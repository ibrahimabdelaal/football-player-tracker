#Football Player Tracking using Bytetrack
Goal
The goal of this project is to address challenges in tracking soccer players and the ball during matches.

Pipeline Approach
We propose a pipeline that integrates both the original Bytetrack model and the Bytetrack_Reid model.

Dual Tracking
We utilize two trackers simultaneously:

Bytetrack: This tracker is dedicated to soccer player tracking.
Bytetrack_Reid: This tracker is specifically designed for ball tracking.
Leveraging Strengths
Bytetrack: This tracker offers a tradeoff between accuracy and speed for player tracking.
Bytetrack_Reid: This tracker enhances ball tracking capabilities.
Enhanced Performance
By integrating both trackers, we aim to improve the overall tracking performance for soccer players and the ball.

Fine Tuning Process
A fine-tuning process was conducted to optimize the performance of the trackers:

Matching Threshold: Tuning was performed to find the best threshold for matching.
Confidence Threshold: Thresholds were adjusted to enhance confidence in tracking results.
Kalman Filter: Additionally, the Kalman filter was fine-tuned to improve tracking accuracy.
Feature Extractor
For Bytetrack_Reid, we utilized ResNet as the feature extractor. However, it is worth noting that the ResNet model was not fine-tuned specifically for this task. For better results, it is recommended to fine-tune the ResNet model on data relevant to soccer player and ball tracking.

Bird's Eye View
We provide a bird's eye view of the field to visualize player and ball movements during matches. This view offers comprehensive insights into the game dynamics.
